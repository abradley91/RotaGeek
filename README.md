# RotaGeek Contact Us

This is a demo application based around a Contact Us form.

## Contact Us

This page contains the form to create the messages.
When a message is created it is saved to a SQL database.

## Contact Us Messages

This page allows the user to see what messages have been created by the Contact Us form.
The user is able to delete these messages by clicking on the Delete button beside each message.


## Running the Application

- Build the solution in Visual Studio.

  This will create a localdb on startup (connection string can be seen in appsettings.json).
- There is also a unit test project with some tests which can be run.
